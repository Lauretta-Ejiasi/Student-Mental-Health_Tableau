Student Mental Health
In this project, I delved into analyzing Student Mental Health using robust data analysis techniques.

Key highlights of the dashboard include:
Thorough data cleaning and manipulation, ensuring accuracy and reliability of insights.
Calculation of various measures, including counts, percentages, and ratios, to provide comprehensive insights into student mental health trends.
Utilization of calculated columns for key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:
- Total number of students
- Total number of students who sought medical attention.
- Total female and male students

Examination of mental health categories, including panic attacks, anxiety, and depression, through text analysis and calculated measures.
In-depth analysis of gender and departmental breakdowns to identify disparities and trends in mental health issues among students.

The insights gained from this analysis are invaluable for universities and mental health professionals, providing actionable insight to support student well-being and guide intervention strategies.
